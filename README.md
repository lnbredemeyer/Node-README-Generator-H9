# Node-README-Generator-H9

## Description
* Using code, I've created a README generator that users can use to create a README by answering questions through the terminal using Node.

## Built with:
* .js
* node
* npm

## Usage:
* WHEN a user is prompted for information about an application repository
* THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of a project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
* WHEN a project title is entered
* THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
* WHEN a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions is entered
* THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
* WHEN a license for my application from a list of options is chosen
* THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
* WHEN the GitHub username is entered
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
* WHEN an email address is entered
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
* WHEN the links in the Table of Contents are clicked
* THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
